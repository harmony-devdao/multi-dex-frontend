# Multi-Dex-Frontend 

This example shows how to create a custom frontend for deployed 'foreign' contracts.
It's purpose is to highlight the idea, that contracts on the chain are primarily permissionless
and can be integrated by everybody. 

_However, still be careful when using 'unknown' contracts, as there may be bugs, errors or purposefully integrated backdoors from the deployer._

This app is like a very _stupid_ DEX aggregator, where the user can see different rates on different 
exchanges by a simple click.
